# ABSAssessment

This repository is a collaborative workspace for the Dev-10 M08 Pandas and Visualizations Assessment. Collaborators on this repository are Ryan-Arnold Gamilo, Emily Atkinson, Elsa Carlson, and Nolan Thomas.

Due to the collaborative nature of this work, this Github repository contains our main branch, as well as an individual branch for each member of this time to be able to push work from their local environment to their own Github branch without potentially overwriting any information. The work for each individual team member can be found by switching to their named branch, and a summary of all project work is located in the main branch.

For this project, our team explored, called, and created visualizations from the US Census Annual Business Survey API. We looked at the Company Summary dataset, Characteristics of Businesses Owners dataset, and Technology Characteristics of Businesses dataset. In looking through these datasets, our team set out to answer the following questions:

Is there a relationship between the race of owners and the race of employees?
Does the demographic makeup for businesses opened before/after 1980s look different?
What does the demographic makeup of employees look like in relation to the longevity of the business?
What is the relationship between the demographic composition of a business and the business’s specialized technology use?

We chose to split out each question off to an individual team member to dive deeper into the dataset. While all the data has been merged into the main branch for ease of use, a further breakdown of the data can be located in each team member’s individual branch. As we look at Question 1, information and visuals can be located in the branch belonging to Ryan (file: abs-Ryan.ipynb).
Question 2 information is located within the branch belonging to Elsa (file: census-assessment-elsa.ipynb). 
Question 3 information is located in Emily’s branch (file: atkinson_census_notebook.ipynb). 
And Question 4 data is located in Nolan’s branch (file: thomas -census -data.ipynb).

All data extraction, transformation, and visualizations were completed using python libraries and code was written inside of Jupyter notebooks for ease of working with multiple datasets and visualizations. 
A more detailed look at the ETL process can be located in the ETL document within the main branch of this repository.

Finally, for a detailed look on our findings in exploring the questions and the accompanying visualizations that were created to display our findings, refer to the Project Report document located within the main branch that contains the documentation and results that each team member came up with in their research process.
